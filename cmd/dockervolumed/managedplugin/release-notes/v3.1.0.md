## Special Notes

|Note|Description|
|----|-----------|
| **Critical:**  |HPE Nimble Storage continues to qualify configurations between releases. The Validated Configuration Matrix provides information about validated configurations and is updated frequently. It is a good practice to check your system configuration against this online tool. The Validated Configuration Matrix tool is available on HPE InfoSight:  [https://infosight.hpe.com/resources/nimble/validated-configuration-matrix](https://infosight.hpe.com/resources/nimble/validated-configuration-matrix)|
| **Important:**  |HPE Nimble Storage Volumes Plugin for Docker 3.1.0 supports multiple versions of NimbleOS starting with NimbleOS 5.1.3.x. Details about this tool are available on the HPE Nimble Storage Docker Hub at [https://hub.docker.com/plugins/nimble](https://hub.docker.com/plugins/nimble).|
| **Important:**  |HPE Nimble Storage Volumes Plugin for Docker 3.1.0 does not support certified and managed Docker Volume plugins with Kubnernetes. To use Kubernetes on Docker with HPE Nimble Storage, you must use HPE Volume Driver for Kubernetes FlexVolume Plugin 3.1.0.|
| **Important:**  |HPE Nimble Storage Volumes Plugin for Docker 3.1.0 does not support:-   Versions of NimbleOS prior to 5.x.x-   The Docker release of Kubernetes in Docker Enterprise Edition 2.x-   Windows Container|

## Known Issues

The following table lists the known issues for HPE Nimble Storage Volume Plugin for Docker 3.0.0.

|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|NLT-1630|nlt.docker.vol|XFS Mount Error| If the event of a failover or failback, there may be scenarios in which the mount fails due to errors such as the following: <br>1. rc=32 err=mount: /dev/mapper/mpathfhw: can't read superblock <br>2. rc=888 mount timed out | Repair the filesystem on the volume: <br>1. Stop the nimbled service on host \(systemctl stop nimbled\) <br>2. On the array, add the ACL to the volume. <br>3. Scan the device from the host and find its mpath name: echo "- - 99" \> /sys/class/scsi\_host/host7/scan echo "- - 99" \> /sys/class/scsi\_host/host8/scan <br>4. Create a temporary directory to mount the volume: mkdir -p /tmp/kk <br>5. Mount the volume: mount /dev/mapper/mpathfhw /tmp/kk <br>6. Repair the filesystem on the volume and then verify the data is recovered: xfs\_repair /dev/mapper/mpathfhw <br>7. Unmount the volume: umount /tmp/kk <br>8. On the array, remove the ACL from the volume. <br>9. Start nimbled service \(systemctl start nimbled\) <br>10. Once nimbled is up and running, the volume should get mounted from the host and the pod should be able to come up |

|NLT-1611|nlt.docker.vol|Unable to Re-Create Pod When Its Associated PVC is in Terminating State|Known issue as per https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1570606|None.|
|NLT-1548|nlt.docker.vol|PVC Creations Stuck in Pending State on Ubuntu 18.04 node|When creating a large number of PVCs \(100s\), HPE Nimble Storage has observed that the multipathd daemon on the host times out with certain commands like "show paths" and "show maps‚Äù. Due to this, the volume plugin cannot fetch mounted devices/path information, which causes PVC creations to be stuck in a pending state. multipathd and systemd-udevd services also seem to hang, causing failures with any further volume attached to the node.|Currently there is no fix for this. HPE Nimble Storage is working with Ubuntu support on getting this issue fixed in multipath-tools updates. This was seen with large number of PVC creates \(100s\). To mitigate this issue, the storage administrator should create PVCs in an incremental fashion \(20-50\) on Ubuntu 18.04. Once the fix is available in multipath-tools, this limitation can be ignored.|
|NLT-1594|nlt.docker.vol|Unable to Mount Volumes Due to Multipathd Errors, Such as "failed in domap"| At times, multipathd is unable to add SCSI paths for the volume into multipath tables. After udev event is generated, the following errors can appear in /var/log/syslog or in /var/log/messages: multipathd show paths hcil dev dev\_t pri dm\_st chk\_st dev\_st next\_check 635:0:0:0 sdad 65:208 50 undef undef unknown orphan 636:0:0:0 sdae 65:224 50 undef undef unknown orphan snapshot from /var/log/messages multipathd\[1998\]: mpathvw: failed in domap for addition of new path sdad multipathd\[1998\]: uevent trigger error | Re-Trigger udev add events by running the following command and reconfigure multipathd. udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=block --action=add multipathd reconfigure |
|NLT-1354|nlt.docker.vol|Container on Upstream Become Inaccessible after Takeover and reverseRepl.|After the downstream replica volume is imported with takeover and reverRepl enabled it would reverse the replication direction making the original upstream volume as replica and offline. This could cause any active container on the original upstream volume to be inaccessible.|Make sure there are no active containers or I/O running on the upstream volume when a takeover with reverseRepl is initiated on the downstream.|
|NLT-1350| nlt.docker.vol |Import Docker Volume Breaks Original Replication Synchronization with Takeover|When a volume is imported with takeover on the downstream with the takeover option, both upstream and downstream become joint owners of the volume collection. If replication is enabled on this volume, it will cause a synchronization error.|To avoid a synchronization error, only one group should be the owner. The original volume on upstream needs to demote itself so that only the downstream is the owner.|
|CON-102|managed\_plugins|Errors from Docker Compose Are Not Propagated to the Plugin Logs|Errors to provision/mount/unmount volumes are not visible in the plugin logs when using Docker compose.|The logs can be seen in /var/log/messages in the following locations:\* /var/log/messages in Redhat/Centos-based systems\* /var/log/syslog in Debian/Ubuntu-based systems |
|CON-132|managed\_plugins|Upgrade from NLT to Volume Plugin for Docker References Older Plugin|During upgrade from NLT to Volume Plugin for Docker may still be referencing the old socket that NLT used to talk to Docker becasue both are registered as Nimble plugins|Restart the Docker service to make Docker register with the new socket and resolve the issue.|
|CON-346|con.docker.vol|Mount Operation Fails with Multipath Error "Error Receiving Packet" When a Large Number of Volumes are Connected to Host|This is due to a known issue: [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3350821](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3350821)|Add the parameter uxsock\_timeout 10000 to the defaults section of the multipath.conf file for Ubuntu 16.04/18.04.|
